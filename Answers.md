1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Components are used to build complex, scalable apps in React.
 
2. What does it mean to think in react?

To think in react is to think in small, composable, reusable blocks of UI. This allows for making simple things then combining those things into complex apps.
 
3. Describe state.

A state makes components dynamic, it is how a component renders and behaves. It could take the form of an array, number, or other data form with the use of a hook (useState).
 
4. Describe props.

Props, or properties, allow functions within components to become reusable. 
 
5. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
 
 A side effect affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. Mostly involved when fetching data. Side effects could require cleanup or not. useEffect is used to avoid bugs/inconsistency from side effects.
